4) add from github(BAH/dev0 branch) get cartographer_ros, cartographer, azure_kinect_ros_driver to c:\catkin_ws\src\
    add abseil-cpp from github to c:\catkin_ws 
5) run C:\catkin_ws\src\cartographer\scripts\install_abseil.sh (manually at cmd prompt)

6) uninstall cartographer from ros,  e.g. rename C:\opt\ros\noetic\x64\include\cartographer -> C:\opt\ros\noetic\x64\include\[uninstall]cartographer ( same for cartographer_ros)
