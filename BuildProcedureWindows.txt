# cartographer ROS build procedure on windows
get catkin workspace per
# requires noetic at c:/opt/noetic
#  also:  c:\opt\ros\noetic\x64\setup.bat
# use the pkg install added <where to add pkg.rosinstall>
# with instructions here
https://ms-iot.github.io/ROSOnWindows/GettingStarted/UsingROSonWindows.html
# cd c:\catkin_ws c:\catkin_ws
# copy pkg.rosinstall to 
#vcs import --force src < pkg.rosinstall
## looks like only need cartographer and cartographer_ros for build.  pkg.rosinstall has a lot more stuff, not necessary

# use https://github.com/bartholmberg/abseil-cpp/tree/BAH/dev0 into c:\catkin_ws
#catkin_make_isolated   --install --use-ninja
